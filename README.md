This is my first personal project, a flashcard app built in Python, using the standard Tkinter library.

Time spent on the project:

1 hour - First concepts, general approach and initial commit
1 hour - Starting to familiarize myself with Tkinter ([TkDocs Tutorial](https://tkdocs.com/tutorial/index.html))
1/2 hour - UI sketch
1 hours - Tk UI started, grids
2 hours - Sketchpad (Tk Canvas)
1 hour - Pathing and JSON creation
1/2 hour - Saving sketchpad lines and ignoring button area
4 hours - More JSON handling, Combobox
3 hours - Removing lines and text, loading lines and text from saved projects, New button functionality
1 hour - Front button, back button, preparing saving
1 hour - Save button
1/2 hour - Delete button, changed order of functions in windows.py
3 hours - Clear button, Next Button, Card selection
1 hour - Rest of buttons, functionally complete

Fixes / Changes:
- Random button not choosing the same flashcard you are already on
- Using New not defaulting the UI to the Back of the Flashcard
- Flashcard-Selector not empty after using New
- Disabling Previous button if the Flashcard-Selector is on 1
