This is my first personal project, a flashcard app built in Python, using the standard Tkinter library.

Time spent on the project:

1 hour - First concepts, general approach and initial commit
1 hour - Starting to familiarize myself with Tkinter ([TkDocs Tutorial](https://tkdocs.com/tutorial/index.html))
1/2 hour - UI sketch
1 hours - Tk UI started, grids
2 hours - Sketchpad (Tk Canvas)
1 hour - Pathing and JSON creation
1/2 hour - Saving sketchpad lines and ignoring button area
